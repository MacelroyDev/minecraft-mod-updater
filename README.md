# minecraft-mod-updater

Tired of your friends asking you how to add new mods to minecraft? Then this is the perfect solution for you! I know mod launchers exist but this is for those who still like adding mods the old-fashioned way. I also used this project as a way to start learning and practice Golang.

## üöÄ Minecraft Mod Pack Auto-Updater

A simple, single-file Go application that automatically downloads and installs the latest version of a Minecraft mod pack to the user's local **mods** folder.

This application simplifies mod pack distribution by checking a single remote URL for the latest mod pack ZIP file, ensuring all players have the same files without needing to delete or manage old versions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions for Your Own Mod Pack

Follow these steps to customize this updater for your specific mod pack:

### Step 1: Host Your Mod Pack Files (GitHub Releases)

You need to host your complete mod pack as a single ZIP file and get a permanent download URL.

1. Create Your ZIP: Gather all your **.jar** mod files and compress them into a single file named something like **modpack-v1.0.0.zip**. The **.jar** files should be at the root of the archive (not inside a subfolder).

2. Create a Public Repository: If you haven't already, create a public GitHub repository (e.g., **username/modpack-files**).

3. Create a Release: Go to the Releases tab in your repository and click "Draft a new release." (If the Releases tab is missing, create a temporary **README.md** first).

4. Upload: Use the "Attach binaries" section to upload your **modpack-v1.0.0.zip**.

5. Publish: Publish the release (you must assign a tag like **v1.0.0**).

6. Copy the URL: Right-click the uploaded ZIP file link under Assets and copy the link address. This is your direct ZIP download link.

### Step 2: Set Up the Permanent Manifest URL (Vercel/Web Host)

This is the permanent link the application checks for the latest mod pack URL.

1. Create **latest_url.txt**: In your website's public file directory (e.g., the **public** folder of your Vercel-hosted React site), create a plain text file named **latest_url.txt**.

2. Paste the URL: Inside this file, paste the direct ZIP download link you copied in Step 1.

3. Commit and Deploy: Commit and deploy your website to Vercel.

4. Final Manifest URL: Your permanent manifest URL will be your site's domain plus the file name (e.g., https://my-modpack.vercel.app/latest_url.txt).

### Step 3: Update the Go Source Code

You only need to update the single hard-coded constant in the Go source code.

1. Open the **downloader.go** file.

2. Replace the placeholder URL for ManifestURL with your actual, permanent Vercel URL from Step 2.

    // downloader.go

    // This must be the permanent URL pointing to your 'latest_url.txt' file.
    const ManifestURL = "[https://my-modpack.vercel.app/latest_url.txt](https://my-modpack.vercel.app/latest_url.txt)" 


### Step 4: Compile and Distribute

Compile the application to create a dependency-free executable for your users.

Navigate to your project folder and run the appropriate command based on the target operating system (using PowerShell syntax):

| Target OS| Command (in PowerShell) |
| ---------| ----------- |
| Windows | $env:GOOS="windows"; $env:GOARCH="amd64"; go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o modupdater-windows.exe . |
| macOS   | $env:GOOS="darwin"; $env:GOARCH="amd64"; go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o modupdater-macos .        |
| Linux   | $env:GOOS="linux"; $env:GOARCH="amd64"; go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o modupdater-linux .         |


Distribute the resulting executable (e.g., **modupdater-windows.exe**) to your friends.

## üîÅ How to Update Your Mod Pack (No Code Changes Needed!)

Once the Go executable is distributed, future updates are simple:

Create your new ZIP file (e.g., **modpack-v2.0.0.zip**).

Create a new GitHub Release and upload **modpack-v2.0.0.zip**.

Copy the new direct download link for the **v2.0.0** ZIP file.

Update **latest_url.txt**: Edit the **latest_url.txt** file on your web host (Vercel) and paste the new **v2.0.0** URL inside it, replacing the old one.

Commit and push the **latest_url.txt** update to Vercel.

The distributed updater will now automatically check the permanent Vercel link and download the new **v2.0.0** mod pack the next time it runs!
